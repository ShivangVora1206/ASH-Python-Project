        "## Description\n",
        "This is a python program intended to help users learn german words easily and build their vocabulary. The program will display a german word and the user will have options to flip the cards and see the meaning. The user can then choose whether they know the meaning or not. The program will keep track of the user's progress and display the words that the user is struggling with more frequently. The user can evaluate their level with a test mode. At the end of the test, the program will display the user's level based on the CEFR scale and also provide a PDF of the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Goals of the Project\n",
