        "## Description\n",
        "This is a python program intended to help users learn german words easily and build their vocabulary. The program will display a german word and the user will have options to flip the cards and see the meaning. The user can then choose whether they knew the meaning or not. The program will keep track of the user's progress and display the words that the user is struggling with more frequently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Goals of the Project\n",
        "1. Create a database for the german words and their meanings\n",
        "2. Implement game logic and an algortihm to track user progress\n",
        "3. Create a user interface for the game\n",
        "4. (Optional) Implement a feature to add new words to the database\n",
        "\n",
        "### Roadmap to Reach the Goal\n",
